PROBLEM #1
Title: “Communicate with LLMs efficiently”
Copy: “Natural language entropy (aliasing, coreference drift) creates instruction variance. Unbounded decoding and schema-free replies yield nondeterministic I/O and brittle post-processing.”

Core meaning • Prompt wording ambiguity (aliasing, drift) → the model interprets instructions inconsistently.
• Sampling strategies or long outputs (“unbounded decoding”) magnify variance.
• Free-form JSON/markdown answers break downstream parsing.

Why users feel this pain • Higher defect rate: same prompt can succeed in test but fail in prod due to subtle aliasing.
• Ops toil: every new prompt wording requires new brittle regex / JSON fix-ups.
• Latency and cost both shoot up when retries or long generations occur.

What could be strengthened • Specify what “entropy” concretely means (e.g., synonyms like “employee” vs “staff”).
• Add an example of a post-processing failure (e.g., key missing in JSON, causing 500s).
• Explicitly name the business impact (lost revenue, compliance risk).

Evidence you can surface • % of prod requests that need a second call because the schema didn’t match.
• Mean / 95-th-percentile tokens per successful answer before and after schema controls.
• Support tickets tagged “model output invalid” over time.

────────────────────────────────────────────── PROBLEM #2
Title: “Control cost without degrading quality”
Copy: “Context bloat, verbose system prompts, and inefficient routing inflate tokens. Lack of attribution hides $/correct-answer and latency tail blowups.”

Core meaning • Excess context & verbose prompts → higher token usage.
• Without good request routing (model choice, instruct vs chat), money is wasted.
• No granular attribution ⇒ teams can’t see dollars per success, so overspend continues.

Why users feel this pain • CFO/FinOps visibility: monthly OpenAI bill unpredictable.
• Quality/latency trade-offs hidden—teams default to GPT-4 even for trivial lookups.
• Long system prompts can exceed model limits → truncation silently drops critical info.

What could be strengthened • Quantify “context bloat” (e.g., “average request now 7 KB; 80 % is boilerplate”).
• Distinguish token cost from tail-latency cost; both hit user SLAs differently.
• Note organizational blockers: approvals required to down-route to lower-tier model.

Evidence you can surface • Histogram of tokens/request before vs after prompt compression.
• $/successful answer by model class (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4) and use-case.
• P95 latency vs prompt length charts to show tail blowups.

────────────────────────────────────────────── High-level gaps across both problems

• Missing 3-rd pain point: maintaining deterministic behaviour across model/version upgrades.
• No mention of security / PII redaction risk in free-form generations.
• Could link each pain directly to capabilities your product will ship (e.g., “contract-based prompts”, “automatic context pruning”, “usage attribution dashboards”).

────────────────────────────────────────────── Next steps you might consider

Tighten copy so non-experts instantly grasp the pain (avoid niche jargon like “aliasing”).
Add one-sentence “impact” line under each problem summarizing cost/time lost today.
Supply real-world metric or anecdote (even anonymized) to build credibility.
If you foresee additional problem buckets (governance, reliability, security), surface them now so the narrative feels complete.
Let me know if you’d like drafts of revised wording or associated visuals/metrics!
